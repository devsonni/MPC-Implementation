# NMPC Implementation 🕹️     

👉 For simple intiution Model predictive control uses the system model to do prediction of future states of system for some predicted optimal inputs in prediction horizon, and applys only one input and does the same process again to compansate the unmeasured noise or disturbance in system.      
👉 In this instance our system is unmaned arieal vehicle and it's following the target which is mobile vehicle.       
👉 The cost function that sould be minimize for predicted inputs is made by the distance between UAV and target which is moving.
